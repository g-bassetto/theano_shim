===========================================

Description
===========
A simple convenient exchangeable interface, so we don't need
conditionals just to select between e.g. T.sum and np.sum.
More specific calls can be dealt with in the related code by
conditioning on this module's `use_theano` flag

This module's `lib` attribute will be attached to either theano.tensor
or numpy, such that calls can be made as `theano_shim.lib.sum`.
It also provides interchangeable interfaces to common operations,
such as type casting and checking, assertions and rounding, as well
as 'shim' datatypes for random number streams and shared variables.


Usage
=====
At the top of your code, include the line
`import theano_shim as shim`
By default this will not even try to load Theano, so you can use it on
a machine where Theano is not installed.
To 'switch on' Theano, add the following below the import:
`shim.use_theano()`
You can switch it back to its default state with `shim.load(False)`.


Development status
==================
This is an alpha release, so you should not blindly trust
the functions in this package.
More importantly, the functions provide far from complete
coverage of the Theano/Numpy APIs, so expect to need
to extend it for your needs (don't forget to share your
contributions back upstream ! =) ). For this reason, a
'Development Installation' is the preferred means of
installing this module, so it doesn't need to be reinstalled
after every modification.


Development installation
===============================

- Create the virtual environment if required

  python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ~/usr/venv/mackelab

  You can omit --system-site-packages if you install all dependencies (like
  SciPy) within the virtual environment.


- Activate the virtual environment

  source ~/usr/venv/mackelab/bin/activate


- cd to the directory containing this file


- Install the code in "Development mode"

  pip install -e .
